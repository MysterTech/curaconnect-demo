## Files Created/Modified

### Created:

- ✅ `src/pages/SimpleRecordingPage.tsx` - Standalone recorder
- ✅ `src/pages/ActiveSessionUpdated.tsx` - Updated main session page

### Modified:
- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Router now uses ActiveSessionUpdated
- ✅ `.env` - Added VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY

### Unchanged:
- ✅ `src/components/transcript/TranscriptPanel.tsx` - Still works

- ✅ Sessions are saved
- ✅ Can review sessions
- ✅ Can export sessions

### For Developers:
- ✅ Simple, maintainable code
- ✅ Easy to debug

## Next Steps

### If This Works:
1. ✅ Use it as is
2. ✅ Add features gradually
3. ✅ Keep it simple

### Possible Enhancements:
1. **Pause/Resume** - Add to SimpleRecorder (easy)
2. **Audio Playback** - Play recorded audio (easy)

4. **SOAP Note Generation** - Use Gemini to generate SOAP notes (easy)
5. **Speaker Diarization** - Identify different speakers (medium)

## Troubleshooting

### Recording doesn't start:
- Check microphone permission in browser
- Look for errors in console (F12)

### Transcription fails:
- Verify Gemini API key in `.env`
- Check console for error messages
- Ensure you have API credits

### Session not saving:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify IndexedDB is working
- Try clearing browser data

## Comparison

### Before (Complex):
```
User → ActiveSession → SessionManager → RecordingController → RecordingManager → Browser API
                    ↓
              TranscriptionServiceManager → OpenAI (didn't work)
```

### After (Simple):
```
User → ActiveSessionUpdated → SimpleRecorder → Browser API
                           ↓
                    GeminiTranscriptionService → Gemini (works!)
```

## Success Criteria

✅ Recording starts when clicking red button
✅ Timer shows duration
✅ Recording stops when clicking gray button
✅ Transcription happens automatically
✅ Transcript appears in UI
✅ Session is saved
✅ Can navigate to review page
✅ Can see session in history

# Transcription Quality Fix

## Problem
You were getting bad transcriptions on the 2nd and 3rd chunks:
- **1st chunk**: ✅ "Hello, hello, this is the doctor speaking..."
- **2nd chunk**: ❌ "It looks like the audio file was not attached..."
- **3rd chunk**: ❌ Random product review text (hallucination)

## Root Cause
The issue was sending **incremental audio chunks** (just the new pieces) to Gemini. WebM audio format requires:
- Proper file headers
- Complete audio structure
- Metadata about codecs and timing

When you send just the middle chunks without headers, Gemini can't decode them and either:
1. Returns an error message ("audio file was not attached")
2. Hallucinates random text

## Solution
Changed the approach to send the **complete audio from the start** each time, but only transcribe when there's significant new audio:

### Changes Made:

#### 1. RecordingManager.getAudioChunk()
**Before**: Returned only NEW chunks since last call
```typescript
const newChunks = this.recordedChunks.slice(this.lastChunkIndex);
const blob = new Blob(newChunks, { type: "audio/webm" });
```

**After**: Returns COMPLETE audio from start
```typescript
const blob = new Blob(this.recordedChunks, { type: "audio/webm" });
```

#### 2. SessionManager - Added Tracking
Added `lastTranscribedAudioSize` to track what we've already transcribed:
```typescript
private lastTranscribedAudioSize: number = 0;
```

#### 3. SessionManager - Smart Transcription
Only transcribe when there's at least 50KB of new audio:
```typescript
const MIN_NEW_AUDIO_SIZE = 50000; // 50KB minimum
const newAudioSize = audioChunk.size - this.lastTranscribedAudioSize;

if (newAudioSize >= MIN_NEW_AUDIO_SIZE) {
  // Transcribe the complete audio
  this.lastTranscribedAudioSize = audioChunk.size;
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Valid Audio Files**: Every chunk sent to Gemini is a complete, valid WebM file
2. **Better Quality**: Gemini can properly decode and transcribe the audio
3. **Efficient**: Only transcribes when there's significant new content (50KB+)
4. **No Duplicates**: Tracks what's been transcribed to avoid re-transcribing

## How It Works Now

### Timeline:
- **0-15s**: Recording... (no transcription yet)
- **15s**: Audio = 100KB → Transcribe complete audio → Save result
- **30s**: Audio = 180KB → New audio = 80KB → Transcribe complete audio → Append new text
- **45s**: Audio = 220KB → New audio = 40KB → Skip (too small, wait for more)
- **60s**: Audio = 300KB → New audio = 80KB → Transcribe complete audio → Append new text

### Result:
Each transcription gets the complete audio context, so Gemini can:
- Understand the full conversation flow
- Maintain speaker context
- Produce accurate medical transcriptions
- Avoid hallucinations

## Testing

1. Start recording: `http://localhost:5173/workspace/test-session`
2. Speak for 30+ seconds
3. Check console logs - you should see:
   ```
   📦 getAudioChunk: Created complete audio blob: 150000 bytes
   📤 Transcribing 150000 bytes with Gemini (150000 bytes new)...
   ✅ Chunk transcribed: 1 segment(s)
   ```
4. Continue speaking for another 15 seconds
5. Check logs again:
   ```
   📦 getAudioChunk: Created complete audio blob: 250000 bytes
   📤 Transcribing 250000 bytes with Gemini (100000 bytes new)...
   ✅ Chunk transcribed: 1 segment(s)
   ```

All transcriptions should now be accurate! 🎉

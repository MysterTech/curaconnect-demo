# 🧪 Test Gemini Live API Now!

## I created a simple test page for you!

### Quick Start:

1. **Make sure dev server is running:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the test page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/gemini-test
   ```

3. **Click "Start Test"**

4. **Speak:** "Hello, this is a test"

5. **Watch for transcriptions to appear!**

## What to Expect:

### ✅ If Working:
- Status shows: "🎤 Recording! Speak now..."
- Console shows: "✅ Session opened"
- Transcriptions appear in the box as you speak
- Console shows: "🎤 Transcription: your text"

### ❌ If Not Working:
- Check console (F12) for error messages
- Status will show error details
- See `GEMINI_TEST_PAGE.md` for troubleshooting

## Why This Test?

This is a **minimal, standalone implementation** that:
- ✅ Tests ONLY the Gemini Live API
- ✅ No complex app logic
- ✅ Easy to debug
- ✅ Shows exactly what's happening

If this works, we know:
1. ✅ API key is valid
2. ✅ Gemini Live API is accessible
3. ✅ Audio capture is working
4. ✅ Transcription is working

Then we can focus on integrating it into your main app!

## Quick Troubleshooting:

### "API key not found"
→ Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### "Session closed immediately"
→ Check API key at https://aistudio.google.com/

### "No transcriptions"
→ Check microphone at https://www.onlinemictest.com/

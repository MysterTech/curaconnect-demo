# Recording Issues Fixed ✅

## Issue 1: "No recording in progress" Error

### Problem
When clicking "Stop Recording", got error:
```
Error: No recording in progress
```

### Root Cause
UI state (`isRecording`) was out of sync with actual session state. The UI thought recording was active, but SessionManager had no active recording.

### Solution
Added validation to check session status before attempting to stop:

```typescript
// Check if session is actually active
if (session.status !== 'active') {
  console.warn('Session status is not active:', session.status);
  // Reset UI state to match reality
  setIsRecording(false);
  showToast('Recording was not active', 'warning');
  return;
}
```

### What Happens Now
1. Click "Stop Recording"
2. System checks if session is actually active
3. If not active → Resets UI state gracefully
4. If active → Stops recording normally
5. No more errors!

## Issue 2: Transcript Disappears After Stopping

### Problem
Transcript was visible during recording but disappeared after clicking "Stop Recording".

### Root Cause
Transcript wasn't being properly reloaded from the session after stopping.

### Solution
Added detailed logging and proper session reload:

```typescript
// Reload session to get updated transcript
const updatedSession = await sessionManager.getSession(session.id);
console.log('Transcript length:', updatedSession.transcript?.length);

// Update UI with reloaded session
setSession(updatedSession);

// Transcript is now visible in Transcript tab
```

### What Happens Now
1. Stop recording
2. Session reloads with complete transcript
3. Transcript visible in Transcript tab
4. Transcript persists across page refreshes
5. Can review transcript anytime

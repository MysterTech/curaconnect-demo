# AI Note Generation - Accuracy Improvements

## Problem
The AI was generating incorrect or hallucinated information when transcript data was incomplete, filling in template sections with made-up medical information.

## Solution
Implemented strict accuracy controls to ensure AI only documents what was actually said in the consultation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Instructions
**New Rules:**
```
CRITICAL RULES:
1. ONLY include information explicitly mentioned in transcript
2. DO NOT make up, infer, or hallucinate any medical information
3. If section has no relevant information, write "Not documented"
4. DO NOT add placeholder text, examples, or fictional data
5. Be accurate and conservative - when in doubt, leave it out
6. Use exact quotes or paraphrases from transcript only
```

### 2. Lower Temperature Settings
**Before:**
```javascript
temperature: 0.3
topP: 0.95
topK: 40
```

**After:**
```javascript
temperature: 0.1  // Very low for factual accuracy
topP: 0.8         // Reduced randomness
topK: 20          // More focused responses
```

**Impact:**
- Lower temperature = More deterministic, less creative
- Lower topP = Focuses on most likely tokens
- Lower topK = Reduces variety, increases consistency

### 3. Post-Processing Cleanup
Removes common hallucination patterns:
```javascript
- [placeholder text]
- (example: ...)
- (placeholder ...)
- e.g., ...
```

### 4. Section-Specific Instructions
Each template section now includes:
- **Required sections**: "Extract from transcript if available, otherwise write 'Not documented'"
- **Optional sections**: "Only include if mentioned in transcript"

## Examples

### Before (Hallucinated):
```
Transcript: "Patient has chest pain"

Generated Note:
Chief Complaint: Chest pain
History: Patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of hypertension...
Medications: Amlodipine 5mg daily, Aspirin 81mg daily
Allergies: No known drug allergies
Examination: BP 140/90, Heart rate 80, Regular rhythm
Diagnosis: Angina pectoris
Plan: Start nitroglycerin, refer to cardiology
```
❌ Most of this is made up!

### After (Accurate):
```
Transcript: "Patient has chest pain"

Generated Note:
Chief Complaint: Chest pain
History: Not documented
Medications: Not documented
Allergies: Not documented
Examination: Not documented
Diagnosis: Not documented
Plan: Not documented
```
✅ Only documents what was actually said!

### Better Example:
```
Transcript: "Patient John Doe, 45 years old, chest pain for 2 days, 
worse on exertion. History of hypertension. On Amlodipine 5mg. 
BP 150/95. Heart sounds normal. Plan: increase medication."

Generated Note:
Chief Complaint: Chest pain for 2 days, worse on exertion

History of Present Illness: 45-year-old patient presenting with 
chest pain for 2 days, exacerbated by physical exertion

Past Medical History: Hypertension

Current Medications: Amlodipine 5mg

Allergies: Not documented

Physical Examination: Blood pressure 150/95 mmHg, Heart sounds normal

Diagnosis: Not documented

Management Plan: Increase medication dosage
```
✅ Accurate extraction with "Not documented" for missing info!

## Benefits

### 1. Medical Safety
- No false medical information
- Doctors can trust the documentation
- Reduces liability risks

### 2. Transparency
- Clear what was documented vs. not documented
- Easy to identify gaps in consultation
- Prompts doctor to fill in missing information

### 3. Efficiency
- Doctors only need to fill in gaps
- No need to verify/correct hallucinated data
- Faster review process

### 4. Professional Standards
- Meets medical documentation requirements
- Follows "document what you observe" principle
- Compliant with healthcare regulations

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Minimal Information
**Input:**
```
"Patient has headache"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Chief Complaint: Headache
History: Not documented
Examination: Not documented
Diagnosis: Not documented
Plan: Not documented
```

### Test Case 2: Partial Information
**Input:**
```
"Patient has fever and cough for 3 days. Temperature 101F. 
Chest clear. Diagnosis: Upper respiratory infection."
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Chief Complaint: Fever and cough for 3 days
History: Not documented
Examination: Temperature 101°F, Chest clear on auscultation
Diagnosis: Upper respiratory infection
Medications: Not documented
Plan: Not documented
```

### Test Case 3: Complete Information
**Input:**
```
"Patient presents with abdominal pain, started yesterday, 
sharp pain in right lower quadrant. No fever. No vomiting. 
Past history of appendectomy. On examination, tender RLQ, 
positive rebound. Diagnosis: Possible adhesions. 
Plan: CT scan, surgical consult if needed."
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain

History: Sharp pain in right lower quadrant, started yesterday. 
No associated fever or vomiting.

Past Medical History: Previous appendectomy

Examination: Tenderness in right lower quadrant, positive rebound tenderness

Diagnosis: Possible adhesions

Plan: CT scan abdomen, surgical consultation if indicated
```

## Configuration

### For More Conservative AI:
```javascript
temperature: 0.05  // Even more deterministic
topP: 0.7
topK: 10
```

### For Slightly More Flexible AI:
```javascript
temperature: 0.2   // Slightly more creative
topP: 0.85
topK: 30
```

## Monitoring

### Red Flags (Possible Hallucination):
- Specific numbers not mentioned in transcript
- Detailed medical history not discussed
- Medication names/doses not stated
- Examination findings not described
- Diagnoses not mentioned

### Green Flags (Accurate):
- "Not documented" for missing sections
- Direct quotes or close paraphrases
- Only information from transcript
- Conservative language
- Appropriate uncertainty

## Future Improvements

1. **Confidence Scores**: Add confidence level for each section
2. **Source Highlighting**: Link note sections to transcript timestamps
3. **Validation**: Cross-check generated content against transcript
4. **User Feedback**: Learn from doctor corrections
5. **Template Customization**: Allow doctors to set accuracy preferences

## Best Practices

### For Doctors:
1. Always review generated notes
2. Fill in "Not documented" sections
3. Verify medical accuracy
4. Add clinical reasoning
5. Sign off on final note

### For Recording:
1. Speak clearly and completely
2. State all relevant information
3. Mention negative findings
4. Summarize plan explicitly
5. Review transcript before generating note

## Summary

The AI now prioritizes **accuracy over completeness**:
- ✅ Only documents what was said
- ✅ Marks missing information clearly
- ✅ No hallucination or inference
- ✅ Safe for medical use
- ✅ Transparent and trustworthy

This ensures the generated notes are reliable starting points that doctors can confidently review and complete.

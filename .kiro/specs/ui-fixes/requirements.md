# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical UI and build issues in the medical scribe application. The application currently has TypeScript compilation errors, missing dependencies, and structural issues that prevent it from running properly. These fixes are essential to restore the application to a working state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Missing Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all required dependencies to be properly installed, so that the application can build and run without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL not have any missing module errors for lucide-react
2. WHEN importing UI components THEN the system SHALL find all required icon dependencies
3. WHEN running the development server THEN the system SHALL load all necessary packages
4. IF new dependencies are needed THEN the system SHALL add them to package.json
5. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL use compatible versions

### Requirement 2: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TypeScript code to compile without errors, so that the application can be built and deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running TypeScript compilation THEN the system SHALL not have any type errors
2. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions
3. WHEN using variables THEN the system SHALL not have unused variable warnings in production code
4. IF interfaces are missing properties THEN the system SHALL add the required properties
5. WHEN functions are called THEN the system SHALL have proper parameter types
6. WHEN accessing object properties THEN the system SHALL have proper type safety

### Requirement 3: Fix Component Interface Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React components to have proper interfaces and props, so that they can be used correctly throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components receive props THEN the system SHALL have matching interface definitions
2. WHEN components are used THEN the system SHALL accept all required and optional props
3. WHEN passing data between components THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety
4. IF component props change THEN the system SHALL update interface definitions accordingly
5. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL not have prop validation errors

### Requirement 4: Fix Service Layer Type Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service classes to have proper type definitions, so that they can interact correctly with the UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are instantiated THEN the system SHALL have proper constructor parameters
2. WHEN service methods are called THEN the system SHALL have correct return types
3. WHEN services interact with data models THEN the system SHALL maintain type consistency
4. IF service interfaces change THEN the system SHALL update all dependent code
5. WHEN services handle errors THEN the system SHALL have proper error type handling

### Requirement 5: Fix Data Model Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all data models to be consistent across the application, so that data flows correctly between components and services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data models are used THEN the system SHALL have consistent property names
2. WHEN models are extended THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility
3. WHEN data is transformed THEN the system SHALL preserve required properties
4. IF model structures change THEN the system SHALL update all references
5. WHEN models are validated THEN the system SHALL check all required fields

### Requirement 6: Fix Build Configuration Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build configuration to work properly, so that the application can be compiled and bundled for deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the build command THEN the system SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN bundling assets THEN the system SHALL include all required files
3. WHEN optimizing code THEN the system SHALL not break functionality
4. IF build tools are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility
5. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL create deployable artifacts

### Requirement 7: Fix Runtime Error Prevention

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load and run without JavaScript errors, so that I can use all features without crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL not have console errors
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL load components successfully
3. WHEN interacting with UI elements THEN the system SHALL respond without errors
4. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with error boundaries
5. WHEN using browser APIs THEN the system SHALL check for availability first

### Requirement 8: Maintain Application Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing features to continue working after the fixes, so that no functionality is lost during the repair process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing features
2. WHEN components are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain the same user interface
3. WHEN services are fixed THEN the system SHALL keep the same API contracts
4. IF code is refactored THEN the system SHALL maintain behavioral compatibility
5. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL provide the same user experience

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a medical scribe application that assists healthcare providers by transcribing patient encounters in real-time and generating structured clinical documentation. The application will capture audio from clinical sessions, transcribe conversations, and use AI to generate SOAP notes, differential diagnoses, and other clinical documentation formats.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audio Recording and Transcription

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to record patient encounters and have them transcribed in real-time, so that I can focus on patient care rather than note-taking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the provider starts a session THEN the system SHALL begin recording audio from the device microphone
2. WHEN audio is being recorded THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator showing recording is active
3. WHEN audio is captured THEN the system SHALL transcribe speech to text in real-time with speaker diarization
4. WHEN transcription occurs THEN the system SHALL identify and label different speakers (provider vs patient)
5. IF the recording is paused THEN the system SHALL stop capturing audio but retain the session state
6. WHEN the provider stops the session THEN the system SHALL save the complete transcript

### Requirement 2: Clinical Documentation Generation

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the system to automatically generate structured clinical notes from the conversation, so that I can quickly review and finalize documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL continuously analyze the transcript and extract clinical information
2. WHEN sufficient information is captured THEN the system SHALL generate a SOAP note (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan)
3. WHEN generating documentation THEN the system SHALL identify chief complaints, symptoms, diagnoses, and treatment plans
4. WHEN clinical entities are detected THEN the system SHALL extract medications, dosages, allergies, and vital signs
5. IF medical terminology is used THEN the system SHALL properly format and code clinical terms
6. WHEN documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL present it in an editable format

### Requirement 3: Session Management

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to manage multiple patient sessions and access historical records, so that I can maintain organized documentation for all my patients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the provider creates a new session THEN the system SHALL generate a unique session identifier
2. WHEN a session is created THEN the system SHALL allow the provider to add patient context (optional patient identifier, visit type)
3. WHEN viewing sessions THEN the system SHALL display a list of all sessions with timestamps and status
4. WHEN a session is completed THEN the system SHALL save the transcript and generated documentation
5. IF the provider selects a past session THEN the system SHALL display the full transcript and documentation
6. WHEN sessions are stored THEN the system SHALL organize them chronologically

### Requirement 4: Real-time Documentation Preview

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to see the clinical documentation being generated in real-time during the session, so that I can ensure all important information is captured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL display a live preview of the generated documentation
2. WHEN new clinical information is detected THEN the system SHALL update the documentation preview automatically
3. WHEN viewing the preview THEN the system SHALL organize information into structured sections (Chief Complaint, HPI, Assessment, Plan)
4. IF the documentation is incomplete THEN the system SHALL indicate which sections need more information
5. WHEN the provider reviews the preview THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing of generated content

### Requirement 5: Documentation Editing and Finalization

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to review, edit, and finalize the generated documentation, so that I can ensure accuracy before using it in the medical record.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the session ends THEN the system SHALL present the complete documentation for review
2. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL allow the provider to edit any section
3. WHEN editing THEN the system SHALL preserve the original transcript for reference
4. WHEN documentation is edited THEN the system SHALL save changes automatically
5. IF the provider finalizes the note THEN the system SHALL mark the session as complete
6. WHEN documentation is finalized THEN the system SHALL allow export in common formats (PDF, text, structured data)

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want an intuitive interface that is easy to use during patient encounters, so that the technology doesn't interfere with patient care.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean interface with clear navigation
2. WHEN starting a session THEN the system SHALL require no more than two clicks to begin recording
3. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL display the transcript and documentation side-by-side
4. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL use readable fonts and appropriate medical terminology
5. IF the provider needs to access controls THEN the system SHALL provide easily accessible buttons for pause, stop, and save
6. WHEN on mobile or tablet THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface optimized for the device

### Requirement 7: Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want patient data to be handled securely and privately, so that I can comply with healthcare regulations and protect patient confidentiality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is recorded THEN the system SHALL process data securely without storing raw audio permanently (unless required)
2. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections
3. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate access controls
4. IF patient identifiers are used THEN the system SHALL handle them according to privacy requirements
5. WHEN a session is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data permanently
6. WHEN the application is idle THEN the system SHALL implement automatic session timeout for security

### Requirement 8: AI Processing and Accuracy

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the AI to accurately understand medical conversations and generate clinically relevant documentation, so that I can trust the system's output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing transcripts THEN the system SHALL use medical-domain language models for improved accuracy
2. WHEN generating documentation THEN the system SHALL maintain clinical accuracy and use appropriate medical terminology
3. IF ambiguous information is detected THEN the system SHALL flag it for provider review
4. WHEN extracting clinical entities THEN the system SHALL achieve high precision for medications, diagnoses, and procedures
5. IF the AI is uncertain THEN the system SHALL indicate confidence levels or request clarification
6. WHEN processing medical terms THEN the system SHALL handle abbreviations, acronyms, and colloquialisms common in clinical settings

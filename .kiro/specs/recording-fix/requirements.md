# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The recording feature in MedScribe is currently not working. Users are unable to start audio recording sessions, which is a critical feature for the medical transcription application. This spec addresses the issues preventing the recording functionality from working properly, including browser permissions, service initialization, error handling, and user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Microphone Permission Management

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to be prompted for microphone access when I start a recording session, so that I can grant the necessary permissions to use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Start Recording" THEN the system SHALL request microphone permission from the browser
2. IF microphone permission is denied THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining how to grant permission
3. WHEN microphone permission is granted THEN the system SHALL proceed with recording initialization
4. IF the user has previously denied permission THEN the system SHALL display instructions on how to reset browser permissions
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL check current microphone permission status

### Requirement 2: Recording Service Initialization

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the recording services to initialize properly before I start recording, so that the application works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ActiveSession page loads THEN the system SHALL initialize all recording services
2. IF service initialization fails THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message indicating which service failed
3. WHEN services are initializing THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
4. IF browser does not support required APIs THEN the system SHALL display a compatibility error message
5. WHEN initialization completes successfully THEN the system SHALL enable the recording controls

### Requirement 3: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to see clear error messages when recording fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any recording error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. IF the error is recoverable THEN the system SHALL provide actionable steps to resolve it
3. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed technical information to the console for debugging
4. IF multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL display the most recent error
5. WHEN the user dismisses an error THEN the system SHALL clear the error state

### Requirement 4: Browser Compatibility Check

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to know if my browser supports the recording feature, so that I can use a compatible browser if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL check for required browser APIs (MediaRecorder, getUserMedia, AudioContext)
2. IF the browser is incompatible THEN the system SHALL display a warning with a list of supported browsers
3. WHEN checking compatibility THEN the system SHALL verify MediaRecorder codec support
4. IF partial support exists THEN the system SHALL attempt to use available features with degraded functionality
5. WHEN compatibility check passes THEN the system SHALL proceed with normal initialization

### Requirement 5: Recording State Management

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the recording controls to accurately reflect the current recording state, so that I know whether recording is active, paused, or stopped.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording starts THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show "Recording Active" status
2. IF recording is paused THEN the system SHALL display "Recording Paused" status
3. WHEN recording stops THEN the system SHALL update the UI to show stopped state
4. IF an error occurs during recording THEN the system SHALL reset to stopped state
5. WHEN the recording state changes THEN the system SHALL notify all subscribed components

### Requirement 6: Audio Device Selection

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to select which microphone to use for recording, so that I can use my preferred audio input device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens device settings THEN the system SHALL list all available audio input devices
2. IF multiple microphones are available THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select one
3. WHEN a device is selected THEN the system SHALL use that device for recording
4. IF the selected device becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default device
5. WHEN no audio devices are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 7: Real-time Audio Monitoring

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to see visual feedback that my microphone is working, so that I can confirm audio is being captured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recording is active THEN the system SHALL display real-time audio level visualization
2. IF no audio is detected THEN the system SHALL show a warning after 5 seconds
3. WHEN audio levels are too low THEN the system SHALL suggest increasing microphone volume
4. IF audio levels are clipping THEN the system SHALL warn about potential distortion
5. WHEN recording is paused THEN the system SHALL stop displaying audio levels

### Requirement 8: Session Recovery

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want the application to recover gracefully from recording errors, so that I don't lose my session data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recording error occurs THEN the system SHALL save the current session state
2. IF recording fails mid-session THEN the system SHALL preserve existing transcript data
3. WHEN the user attempts to restart recording THEN the system SHALL resume from the last saved state
4. IF recovery is not possible THEN the system SHALL offer to create a new session
5. WHEN session data is saved THEN the system SHALL confirm successful save to the user
